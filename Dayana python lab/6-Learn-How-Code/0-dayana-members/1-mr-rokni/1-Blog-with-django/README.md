In this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a Blog application with Django that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts, and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual post. Django is capable of making more advanced stuff but making a blog is an excellent first step to get a good grasp over the framework. The purpose of this chapter is to get a general idea about the working of Django.

step 1: Generated by ('django-admin startproject myProjectName') using Django 4.0.5 in terminal.

step 2: Install using pip, including any optional packages you want...:

        pip install djangorestframework
        pip install markdown                # Markdown support for the browsable API.
        pip install django-filter           # Filtering support

step 3 : Create our own app with this command :('python manage.py startapp appname') in terminal, and Add my app to the installed app in settings.py

step 4: Add templates and use block and endblock to separate header base sidebar footer


step 4: Add my apps to your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
               `# my app
                'home.apps.HomeAppConfig',
                'account.apps.AccountConfig',
                'blog_post.apps.BlogPostConfig',

                'django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig',
                'django_render_partial',
                'django_social_share',
                # my widget 
                'widget_tweaks',
            ]
            And add static files and media files:

            # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
            STATIC_URL = 'static/'
            MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
            STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR ,"static")]
            MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

step 5: Create your model(appname/models.py) and in terminal we enter makemigration and migrate with their commands
        (python manage.py makemigration ,
        python manage.py migrate)
please check all models

step 6:Create your form(appname/forms.py)
please check all forms

step 7:Create your mixin(appname/mixins.py)

step 8: Create your class base views(appname/views.py)
please check all views

step 9: Register your models(appname/admin.py) & in terminal Create super user with command (python manage.py createsuperuser)

step 10: appname URL Configuration(appname/urls.py)
please check all urls

step 11: myProjectName URL Configuration(appname/urls.py) 
        Add path of urls myProjectName

            urlpatterns = [
                ...
                path('', include('appname.urls'))
            ]
        And add path of statics files
            urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL,document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
